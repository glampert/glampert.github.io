I use this space to write about some of my personal projects and experiments on games programming.
Some of my topics of interest that you will find here:

- Game development
- Graphics and real-time rendering
- Game Engines and low-level programming
- Retro-programming and reverse engineering
- Compilers and programming languages
- General C and C++ coding tips and techniques
- PlayStation 2 homebrew

My professional experience includes Principal Engine Programmer at [**PlayStation London Studio**](https://playstationlondonstudio.com/) developing a proprietary game engine for PlayStation 5 and PC, and Animation Systems Programmer at [**Rockstar North**](http://www.rockstarnorth.com/) developing the animation systems used by *Red Dead Redemption 2* and the *Rockstar Advanced Game Engine* (RAGE).

I'm also Founder & Chief Software Engineer of [**Core System Co-Dev**](https://coresystemcodev.com/), where we provide software co-development and consulting for the gaming industry.
